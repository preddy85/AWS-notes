public ip and private ip:

After creating aws ec2 instance we will get 2 ips
private and public

private ip is used to connect to that instance in your private network ( within that network only )

public ip is used to connect from anywhere ( outside the network )
from www also

If you restart your ec2 instace , public ip will change.
private ip will remain constant

If you dont want to chaange the public ip, we need to go for elastic ip concept.
AWS provides 5 elastic ips which can be tagged to any ec2 instance. once tagged we can use elastic ip to login into that instanse
so, in this case even after restarting ec2 instance. public ip wont change.

==============================================================================

placement groups - ec2 instance 

cluster: ( high perfomace )
=========

low latency:
places in same hardware and same Avalability Zone. ( 1 rack )
10gbps bandwidth between instances

pros: Good networkk
cons: if the rack fails, all ec2 instnances within the rack will gets lost

these types of placement groups are choosed by the applications which needs low latency and high network throughput.
================================================================

spread: ( critiacl network) 
==========
ec2 instance spraed across multiple availability zones
even in case of any failure, less downtime can be identified with less effect of performance
as the instances are in many availability zones, latency will be lil more


partition:  ( Distributed network )
==========

us-east-1a
us-east-1b
upto 7 partitions in each Availability zone ( AZ )
up to 100s of ec2 instances
ec2 instance can access partition informmation through meta data

failure of partition will effect ec2 instances but not other partition.

=================================


ENI ( ELastic network interface )

ENI creation gives one private adress in A.zone which can be attached to any of the instance in same A.zone and can be used as
secondary private adress to that machine
and can be detached ay any time and attach to diff ec2 instance also.
we can have more control over instacnes with this ENI.

use case: our applicaiton is installed in 2 ec2 instances, let say if we got issue in one ec2 instance.
we can access same application from another ec2 instacne but with diff ip.
to avoid this , we can use ENI . attach one secondary ip to ec2 machine
if this ec2 instance fails...detach ENI ( secondary ip from this failed ec2 insyacne ) and attach to another ec2 instance
amd access application with same secondary ip ( ENi Ip)
===========================================
Ec2 Hibernation:

ec2 hibernation will not actually reboot the os ( operating system ) but it will just store the ec2 instance RAM dump in EBS encrypted root volume and
start our instance.

ec2 instance stays in hibernation state not more than 150 days. and applicable only for the instacne under 150gm ram.

Application has lower downtime if we do hiberation instaed of stop/start instance.

uptime commadn will show last restart time of instacne even if u do hibernation.
