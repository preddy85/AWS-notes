Elastic bean stalk - 

Elastic bean stalk volume is a network drive which can be attached to running instances
this will allow us to persist the instance volume after the instace termination.

they can be mounted to one instance at a time.
EBS volumme in us-east-1a can be attached to the instance only in us-east-1a ( Both should be in same Avai zone )
that means they are bound to specific availability zone.

30GB of general purpose SSD will comes under freer trail
anything more than that will be chargable

EBS voume - think as network USB stick

we can attach 2 volumes to single instance and can detach whenever u want.

we need to define below 2 parameters for EBS volumem provision
IOPS - speed 
size 

ec2 instance -------------------------------- EBS volume
               *network speed ( IOPS)
               *not attching physically so 
               easy to detach and attch to another instance
               
----------------------------------------------------------
controlling EBS behaviour :


Basically ec2 instance contains root volume and the volumeu attach (EBS volume )
whenever we terminate ec2 volume , root volume of instance will gets deleted.

to preserve the root volume of ec2 instance even after termination we need to Disable the ( Delete on termination ) in EBS volumes.
-------------------------------------------------------

EBS snapshots:

we can take backup of EBS volume dump and store in the form of EBS snapshots.
and we can restore this snapshop in different availability zones also.

us-east-1a
EBS volume       -------------- ( restore this snapshop in another region us-east-1b)
( take snapshopt)

features of EBS snapshots:

EBS snapshots can be archeived. and if u delete accidentely, they will preset in recyle bin for 1day- 1year ( depends on configuration )
archieve may take 24-72 hrs to use
Moving snapshots to archieve will save us to pay more ( < 75% than normal snapshots)

Fast snapshot restore - we have to pay for this option to retrive snapshot asap.
